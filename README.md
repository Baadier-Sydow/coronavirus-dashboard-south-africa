To build the application, clone the website down. Run `npm install` within the folder to install the dependencies.

Once this is completed you need to install the Ionic CLI tool so that you can run the solution by running `npm install -g @ionic/cli` in your terminal.

The last step is to run `ionic serve` to build and run the application.

Because the application is built using Ionic Framework, you should be able to build and run it on mobile devices once you've setup Cordova or Capacitor.
